2023.08.06 在上海天文馆做志愿者时在地下一层的展览中发现了一首现代诗。  
现将它抄录于此，留作纪念。

<br><font face="楷体" >
银台松摆，水镜游涟，霞光侧峰。 <br>
锐影迟飞渡，群崖袅袅，山移雾淡，孤幕辰星。 <br>
苍宇无穷，生名有尽，何叹白躯试寻端。<br>
更时有，举青觥畅饮，竞斗天年。<br>
绛河无妄真渺，千星坠，亦堪仁赤心。<br>
引慢途旅者，宿衷兰点，哈勃弄彩，尚欠微纤。<br>
长箭神州，飞天月兔，远致天宫并舞高。<br>
弦光定，一索仙帆影，却有新篇。<br>
</font> <br>

<br><font face="Comic Sans MS" >
Pines turn over in the bed of mist, naughty fish wake up the mirror. <br>
The light penetrate the gap of the peak. <br>
The light and shadow of the mountains are constantly changing. <br>
The smoke cloud of the mountains gradually disappear, and the stars come to light. <br>
The universe is endless, but intelligent life is finite. <br>
We keep trying to find the mystery of where we come from and where to go. <br>
More then, raise the toast of wine and fight with all things in the universe. <br>
Milky Way is indeed so empty and lonely. <br>
When the light disappears and the stars are destroyed, <br>
and the sincerity of human beings will still not disappear. <br>
The Voyager 1 travels slowly, and looked homeward at the "Pale Blue Dot". <br>
Hubble determines the universe, but no longer meet our expectations. <br>
The Shenzhou spacecraft, Chang'e and Yutu join hands with Tiangong to chase new peaks. <br>
The knowledge of the universe will one day be more deeply understood by humans <br>
and at that time, it will be our new outset.
